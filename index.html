        <p>
            Josan Gonzalez is an ilustrator from Barcelona, Spain, known on social media as <a
                href="https://www.instagram.com/deathburger/">DeathBurguer</a>. He is the name behind the cyberpunk
            graphic novel series: <strong>The Future is Now</strong>, set in a dystopian cyberpunk world dominated
            by technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            The art book comes in two volumes, both of which have already been published and distributed by the
            artist through <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>, a platform used by the community
            to financially contribute to his work.

            The book is filled with easter eggs and all the elements
            known to make up the cyberpunk atmosphere: the high tech low life premise, the intrincate look of urban
            scenarios, the power hunger corporations, the nonstop surveillance from the government over its
            citizens, the police brutality, the robotic body augmentation and many other themes explored by the
            artist.

            From a technical point of view, his art is incredibly detailed even though he uses flat applications of
            color without any shading. The
            intricacy of his drawings can be seen primarily through the texture details and the highly amount of elements that
            make up the scenes. In a cyberpunk world the frontiers that
            separates one thing from another is blurred by the advancement of technology. Gonzalez makes sure to depict
            this idea very well by connecting everything and everyone with pieces of electronic devices and electric
            cables, which is why you won't see any character, especially a human one, not using some sort of robotic
            augmentation.

            Gonzalez has also made different artworks for Medium Corp, Editora Aleph, Wired Magazine, Paramount
            Pictures, Z2 Comics, Harmonix Systems, Metallica, Mondo, Pearl Jam,
            CDProjekt Red, Epic Games, Riot Games, Dungeons & Dragons and Wizards of The Coast.
